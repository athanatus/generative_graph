# Generative models for generating graphs

Generative models for graphs trained using power system graph data generated by SynGrid

This repository contains the code for creating the generative models for graphs as well as example data that was created using a MATLAB package SynGrid.

## Documentation
### Requirements
To allow users to freely access the code and try the training process, it is implemented in a Google Colab environment, where users are not required to have any installation for running the code. 
Python packages that are used in the code are installed and imported at the beginning blocks of the code.
If the user wishes to download the code and use it in a local environment, the following python packages must be installed
- tensorflow-gpu
- networkx

### How to use
Each ipynb (python notebook) file has explnations before each code block to give users information about the functions of each part of the code.
